## Overview

Child accounts allow organizations to create and manage sub-accounts that:
- Inherit parent account settings
- Use parent account's balance
- Are monitored for usage and activity

## Creating Child Accounts

Child accounts are created through the widget using your parent API key:

```html
<script
  src="https://widget.authiqa.com"
  defer
  data-api-key="YOUR_PARENT_API_KEY"
  action="signup"
></script>
```

## Account Requirements

- Username (unique under parent account)
- Email (unique under parent account)
- Password (8+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Parent's API key (automatically handled by widget)

## Viewing Child Accounts

Monitor your child accounts through the dashboard:

```javascript
GET /auth/child-accounts

// Response
{
  "data": {
    "stats": {
      "total": 5,          // Total child accounts
      "active": 3          // Active in last 30 days
    },
    "accounts": [
      {
        "username": "child1",
        "email": "child1@example.com",
        "lastSeen": "2024-04-08T10:30:00Z",
        "registered": "2024-01-15T08:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Search and filter child accounts by:
- Email/username
- Date range
- Activity status

  - Create other child accounts
  - Access parent account settings
  - Modify billing information
